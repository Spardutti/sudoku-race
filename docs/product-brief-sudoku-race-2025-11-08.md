# Product Brief: Sudoku Daily

**Date:** November 08, 2025
**Author:** Spardutti
**Context:** Startup/Business Venture

---

## Executive Summary

Sudoku Daily is a pure, authentic daily Sudoku platform that brings the social mechanics of Wordle to Sudoku purists. Unlike existing Sudoku apps cluttered with hints and helpers, Sudoku Daily respects the player's intelligence with one daily challenge, no hand-holding, and authentic competitive leaderboards. The product fills a clear market gap: no free daily Sudoku exists with Wordle-style viral sharing mechanics and pure competitive integrity.

**The Opportunity:** 50M daily puzzle players (NYT Games alone), proven Sudoku demand (Sudoku.com #3 in category), and validated viral mechanics (Wordle: 90 → 2M users in 2 months after adding sharing).

**Success Milestone:** 10 daily active users for 1 month (retention validation), with 1,000 DAU as the north star.

**Key Differentiator:** Pure competitive integrity - no AI hints preserves leaderboard authenticity and sharing pride. You finished with YOUR brain, not an algorithm's help.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Problem with Existing Sudoku Apps:**

Sudoku apps have ruined the puzzle experience with excessive hand-holding:
- AI hints that solve parts of the puzzle for you
- Auto-fill features that eliminate the challenge
- Unlimited undo buttons that remove consequences
- Cluttered interfaces with aggressive monetization

These features strip away the satisfaction of authentic puzzle-solving. Sudoku purists - people who truly love the challenge - have abandoned digital apps and returned to pen and paper.

**The Missing Opportunity:**

Daily puzzle games (Wordle, NYT Connections) have proven the power of:
- One daily challenge everyone shares
- Social sharing mechanics that drive viral growth
- Community around a shared experience

But no one has brought this model to Sudoku with pure competitive integrity.

### Problem Impact

**For Sudoku Lovers:**
- Can't find a digital Sudoku experience that respects their intelligence
- Forced to choose between convenience (digital) and authenticity (pen & paper)
- No way to compete fairly or share results meaningfully (existing apps have hints = unfair competition)

**Market Validation:**
- Sudoku.com (traditional unlimited model) is #3 in Puzzles category - demand exists
- Good Sudoku has daily leaderboards but paid barrier limits viral growth
- Research shows players connected to social groups are 2.5x more likely to become long-term gamers

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Traditional Sudoku Apps (Sudoku.com, Microsoft Sudoku):**
- ❌ Unlimited play (no scarcity, no daily ritual)
- ❌ No social sharing mechanics
- ❌ Often include hints/helpers (undermines competitive integrity)
- ❌ No "everyone plays the same puzzle" community feel

**Daily Puzzle Apps (Wordle, NYT Games):**
- ❌ Don't offer Sudoku
- ✅ But proven the model works (50M daily players)

**Good Sudoku (Closest Competitor):**
- ✅ Daily puzzles with global leaderboards
- ❌ Paid app ($5-7) limits viral adoption
- ❌ AI hints undermine competitive authenticity
- ❌ No social sharing features

**Market Gap:** Free daily Sudoku + Wordle-style viral mechanics + pure competitive integrity = SUDOKU DAILY

### Proposed Solution

**Sudoku Daily: The Pure Daily Sudoku Experience**

One daily Sudoku puzzle. Everyone gets the same challenge. No hints. No shortcuts. Just you, the puzzle, and your brain.

**The Experience:**
1. Visit Sudoku Daily each morning
2. Solve today's medium-difficulty puzzle (no help, pure challenge)
3. See your completion time
4. Check the global leaderboard (where would you rank?)
5. Share your result via emoji grid (shows your journey without spoiling)
6. Come back tomorrow for a new challenge

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Radical simplicity** (inspired by a Fortnite countdown timer that sold for $3k - one thing, done perfectly)
- **Newspaper aesthetic** (classic, trustworthy, no clutter)
- **Scarcity creates value** (one puzzle per day increases desire, like Wordle)
- **Respect the player** (no dumbing down, no hand-holding)

### Key Differentiators

**1. Pure Competitive Integrity (No AI Hints)**
- Leaderboards are authentic - everyone solved it themselves
- Sharing results feels meaningful (you earned it)
- Preserves the pride factor that makes puzzle-solving satisfying

**2. Daily Scarcity Model**
- One puzzle per day (vs unlimited play competitors)
- Creates urgency and FOMO
- Builds daily ritual and habit formation

**3. Social Viral Mechanics**
- Emoji grid sharing (tells your story without spoilers)
- "Everyone plays the same puzzle" creates community
- Research-validated: sharing features drove Wordle from 90 → 2M users in 2 months

**4. Free + Accessible**
- No paywall barrier (vs Good Sudoku's $5-7)
- Enables viral growth through guest play
- Freemium model (ads + optional premium)

**5. Newspaper Aesthetic**
- Differentiates from "gamey" cluttered puzzle apps
- Appeals to puzzle purists who value tradition
- Classic meets modern social features

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

**Product Assumptions:**
1. Sudoku purists exist and want a pure digital experience (validated by founder's personal pain point)
2. Medium difficulty calibrated correctly for 70-80% completion (needs testing)
3. Emoji sharing format will be compelling enough to drive virality (needs iteration)
4. Daily scarcity model applies to Sudoku as well as Wordle (logical but unproven)

**Market Assumptions:**
1. Daily puzzle players will try Sudoku (overlapping but different audience from Wordle)
2. Competitive integrity (no hints) is a selling point, not a barrier (validated by research on Good Sudoku)
3. Free model can achieve viral distribution (vs Good Sudoku's paid barrier)

**Technical Assumptions:**
1. Supabase free tier sufficient for MVP scale (100-1000 users)
2. Server-side validation can prevent cheating effectively
3. Next.js + Vercel can handle real-time leaderboard updates

### Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Viral Sharing Doesn't Catch On**
- **Impact:** High (entire growth model depends on it)
- **Probability:** Medium (proven model but execution-dependent)
- **Mitigation:** A/B test multiple sharing formats, analyze Wordle's design deeply, iterate rapidly

**Risk 2: Puzzle Difficulty Not Calibrated**
- **Impact:** High (too hard = frustration, too easy = boring)
- **Probability:** Medium (subjective difficulty)
- **Mitigation:** Test with sample users, target 70-80% completion, monitor data and adjust

**Risk 3: Can't Reach 10 Users**
- **Impact:** High (MVP success criteria not met)
- **Probability:** Low (founder network + Product Hunt + Reddit should get 10)
- **Mitigation:** Seed with personal network, Reddit (r/sudoku, r/puzzles), Product Hunt launch

**Risk 4: Leaderboard Cheating**
- **Impact:** High (destroys competitive integrity core value)
- **Probability:** Medium-High (all leaderboards face this)
- **Mitigation:** Server-side validation, time anomaly detection, auth required for leaderboards, report system

**Risk 5: Good Sudoku Adds Social Features**
- **Impact:** Medium (closest competitor pivots)
- **Probability:** Low (paid model limits viral growth)
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, establish community early, free positioning advantage
